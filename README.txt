Thank you for downloading my "Windows 11 Legacy Options" changer
-- Made by T3K --

How to use:
1 - open Selector.bat
2 - choose current user or all users
3 - change your options (why did they remove that in the first place??)


If you're an advanced user feel free to run the .reg files individually located in the folders labeled Local or System-Wide
